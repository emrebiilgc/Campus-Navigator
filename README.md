# Campus Navigator

This project is a Java application that helps organize a university club fair and provides a navigation assistant for visitors.  
It combines **graph algorithms** and **regular expressions** to solve two related problems:

1. **Club Fair Setup Planning**  
   - Reads booth setup tasks from an XML file.  
   - Calculates earliest possible start and end times for each task.  
   - Produces a schedule with the minimum overall project duration.  

2. **Campus Navigator App**  
   - Reads campus navigation data from a `.dat` file using regular expressions.  
   - Combines walking and golf cart routes to compute the fastest path.  
   - Outputs the total travel time in minutes and step-by-step directions.
